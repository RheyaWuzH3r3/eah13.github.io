I've tried most if not all online IDEs since I use a Chromebook.  Cloud9 has the best balance of functionality and reliability.  
In their premium plan you can create an unlimited amount of private workspaces, letting you isolate each project's settings
in one virtual machine.  You can also create an ssh-based instance, allowing you to use their awesome IDE on a a dev or even 
production server if you need to.  Highly recommended
