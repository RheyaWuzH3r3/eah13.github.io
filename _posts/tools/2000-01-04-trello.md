**Edit:  I love Trello but it was too much tool overhead for what it does.  We use github for planning and I like having 
everyhting in one place**

Trello is a visual way to manage information via digital cards, especially for things like development planning or fundraising that can be conceptualized as funnels.

Trello is organized by columns.  Here are the columns on my fundraising board, left to right:

* **Target Investors** - Investors who I think may be interested in Trinket
* **Getting Intros** - Investors I am actively trying to get intros to.  Funded entrepreneurs or coinvestors are the targets here.
* **Meeting(s)** - Investors who I'm actively meeting with, seeking a commitment
* **Commited** - Investors who have indicated they're willing to invest
* **Closed** - Money in the bank.

Trello is an amazing free product, but the premium service offers additional team management features.
