Jerry Colonna is relentlessly focused on the emotional struggle of being an entrepreneur.  We live amongst our emotions every day as founders.  nless we acknowledge and specifically address their pull, they will pull us in unexpected directions, like a second rudder on a ship we don't control.  This is true for life in general but Jerry is an expert at combining psychological introspection with the particular challenges of being a founder, and especially in the role of CEO.  

The Reboot podcast is recordings of consultations Jerry has with real CEOs.  It's amazing that these founders are willing to share these powerful experiences with the rest of us.  You'll find that some of their stories resonate with you and some don't.  But every episode has given me new emotional tools for steadying the ship I'm on in the midst of the storm that is running a startup.

I listen to it via Stitcher but you can get it on the web via Soundcloud.
