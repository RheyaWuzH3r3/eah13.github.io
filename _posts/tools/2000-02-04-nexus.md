I've had quite a few phones since I started this list but none of them made it on here.  I really loved the 
OnePlus One, but then the screen broke and the lack of a serious company behind the phone became apparent.

Instead of going for the flawed OnePlus Two, I went for Google's top of the line 6P with two years of damage
protection.  THis set me back about $700 but that's two years of guaranteed working phone, and I'm sure this
has the battery life and power to get the job done.

One small thing that makes a huge difference: the fingerprint sensor.  Instead of being on the front like Apple's
iPhones, the sensor is on the back.  THis lets me wake and unlock the phone with one hand.  The sensor is uncannily
accurate and fast.  It's saved my from inputting my pin 100+ times every day like I used to.

The screen is big and bright and lets me get work done on the go.  In fact, I prefer doind things like email and
sometimes even editing google docs via the phone, since I can do it laid back in a comfy position.  This
also helps me keep focused when I'm using my laptop since I mostly use that for coding and other intensive work.

No contract, and if you don't have a current contract with another carrier, you can try Google Fi.
