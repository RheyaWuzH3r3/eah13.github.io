I use Airbnb to find super cheap places when traveling.  I've gotten as low as $40 a night in major cities like SF and NYC.  

My M.O. is to always go for a place close to my meetings.  Location, location, location.  Within that group, I take the absolute cheapest I can find.  Thanks to my Verizon Jetpack, I don't need to worry about internet.  And RelayRides and Lyft have my transportation covered.

I also love Airbnb for vacations, but this is foundertools and founders don't take vacations, right? :)

Use this link to sign up and we'll both get a $25 credit.  Schweet.
