**Edit: From my perspective, the rebranding to Turo was a massive waste of time, money, and brand equity when
the company should have been spending all it had on each on growth.  Huge mistake.**

For around $20 a day you can pick up a car at the airport and drop it back off there when your trip is done.  If you're doing this instead of Uber, you may actually save money and have a car for the whole trip.  If you have a group of people, it may even be less expensive than everyone getting public transit. It is easy, cheap, and consistent.  I always rent the cheapest possible car, and sometimes they give me a Volvo or a Lexus if they're out of Chevy Aveos or whatever.

When I fly into SFO I take the 24 hr A-Loft shuttle to pick up the car from the hotel parking lot.  Easy and convenient- no coordination necesary.

Their business model is brilliant, by the way.  Free parking for owners, saving the $15/day.  Then they rent the cars for ~$20 a day.  

I love using public transport when I can but VCs and schools tend to be in out-of-the-way places where I need a car to get to them.  Relayrides is my weapon of choice.
