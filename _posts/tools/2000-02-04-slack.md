I think Slack's pretty good.  More importantly, it's the best, which is why everyone switched to it so fast.
Whether everyone sticks with it will be a function of their message seach capabilities, which from my
perspective still need a lot of work.  Anyways, you're probably already using Slack so good on ya.

One tip: you can hack premium functionality out of the free plan by making custom private groups to start.
Only put things in Channels that you don't mind contractors and other collaborators seeing and you can
add them to your org without a premium plan.
