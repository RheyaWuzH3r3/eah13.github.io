I bought my Chromebook in January 2014 and love it.  I recommend you get the $380 i3 version with 4GB RAM- that's what I'll be upgrading to soon.  But the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FNPD1VW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00FNPD1VW&linkCode=as2&tag=elliotthauser-20&linkId=UU2OTBYLWZ6KC34V">$199 Celeron version with 2GB ram</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=elliotthauser-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00FNPD1VW" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> that I bought has been enough to run a company, teach a university class, and build this website.  8.5 hours of battery life, super lightweight, and easily replaceable.  Highly recommended!
