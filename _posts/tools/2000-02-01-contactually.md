Contactually is an email workflow disguised as a CRM.  It helps you stay in touch with the most valuable people in your network.  I use it to make sure that contacts who will be crucial in 6-12 months don't fall by the wayside.  You can easily mass-customize an update to get a slightly different version of your startup update to hundreds of people.
