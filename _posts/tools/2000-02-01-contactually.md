Contactually is an email workflow disguised as a CRM.  It helps you stay in touch with the most valuable people in your network.  I use it to make sure that contacts who will be crucial in 6-12 months don't fall by the wayside.  You can easily mass-customize an update to get a slightly different version of your startup update to hundreds of people. 

**An aside regarding their customer service:**

The product as it exists is great, but the support team and how they're improving it leaves a lot to be desired.  They'll chat with you in Olark but when you point out something the product doesn't do they'll tell you to go open an issue on the support forum so people can vote on it.  I don't like this attitude.  When something's wrong with a product or a product doesn't do something the company should have an wholeheartedly apologetic attitude.  I know from experience how hard it is to do everything users want, but it's critical to maintain an attitude of putting users' needs first, even if you (understandably) can't always meet those needs.  

So, in summary, Contactually is imperfect as all products are but I'm worried by their customer service attitude that they won't continue to improve the way they should.  In my opinion they've separated customer service from development too much.  It's OK to [Not Sweat the Medium Stuff](http://www.exitevent.com/article/startup-founders-dont-sweat-the-medium-stuff-13729) but if you let too much of the small stuff slide you're headed towards obsolescence.

We've all got to be [humble](https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-10-13-opinion-humility-in-edtech-or-i-have-no-idea-how-to-teach-your-students), perhaps especially when we don't or can't meet users' needs.  As a Contactually user I would've felt so much better about the exact same product had the person I chatted with been apologetic and said they would work on it instead of explaining why my issue with them not pulling in twitter handles I had already entered on my Gmail contacts wasn't their fault.
