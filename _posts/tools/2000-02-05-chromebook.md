I bought my Chromebook in January 2014 and love it.  I recommend you get the $380 i3 version with 4GB RAM- I just upgraded and I love it.  But the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FNPD1VW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00FNPD1VW&linkCode=as2&tag=elliotthauser-20&linkId=UU2OTBYLWZ6KC34V">$199 Celeron version with 2GB ram</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=elliotthauser-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00FNPD1VW" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> that I bought back in January 2014 has been enough to run a company, teach a university class, and build websites like this.  8.5 hours of battery life, super lightweight, and easily replaceable.  Highly recommended!

**Edit, February 2016**

Still going strong.  I *love* this machine.  For $400 it's one of the best computers you can buy.  Just used my penultimate free Gogo wireless internet pass on a 5 hour flight to get soe work done.  All the details are right, including using peripherals and external monitors.  I'll upgrade at some point but will keep this bad boy around as a second computer, like I did my old 2GB Celeron c720.
