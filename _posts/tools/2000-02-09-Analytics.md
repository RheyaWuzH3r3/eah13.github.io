 Google Analytics is the bread and butter of metrics.  Install the tracking code and get going.  It's got a poor user interface but is absolutely essential.
 
 I'll write a longer post on this one day but the core realization with Analytics is that Users have one or more Sessions, which have one or more Pageviews.  You Segment Users based on characteristics of their Sessions or Pageviews.  And you can set up Goals that are keyed to the properties of Sessions.  Also, there's a tiny button on the far right over search results that lets you build Pivot views of things.  Do this often.
 
 If you've been diving into Analytics and been frustrated with things I hope the cryptic advice makes a lightbulb or two go off.  If not, [tweet me](http://twitter.com/hauspoor) and let me know you'd read the blog post!
