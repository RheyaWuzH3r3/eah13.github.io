Intercom is one of the most valuable products I know.  

It's a messaging app between you and your users.  It lets you seem like you're always there, even when you're not, and respond to users via mobile app or web at any time.  It lets you send automated messages to users based on their behavior or usage of your app.  Welcome messages, user interviews, getting a list of tester users, the list goes on. It's absolutely essential.

True story: we started getting a ton of interest from users in Russia.  I was able to make a special welcome for users based on their browser language using Intercom and a little Google Translate magic.  These users were blown away by the special welcome from a tiny US-based startup and have remained loyal and engaged for us.

For most startups, Intercom and Google Analytics are the only fancy Javascript plugin-type tools you need.  Analytics tells you about users, Intercom connects you to individuals.  Get it.
