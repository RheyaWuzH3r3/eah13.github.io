Teespring is like kickstarter for t-shirts.  Sounds like a dumb idea but it's genius. Everyone can order the size and style they want at no extra charge.  That means no buying xtra smalls and 3XLs you don't need. Trouble is, most startups set the minium number of t-shirts in a campaign too high.

We used Teespring to get t-shirts for ourselves for super precision ordering.  We set the minium order to 5, which made the long-sleeve t-shirts $18 - not bad for printed on demand shirts!  We could also get hoodies for $28.  With the campaign filled with our own orders, we were able to open it up to our friends, family, and key users if they wanted to buy one for themselves.

If you need t-shirts for your startup, I recommend doing the same.  You won't find a much cheaper way to print 5 custom t-shirts and everything you sell beyond that is just marketing for your company.

We kept it simple and just did our logo:
