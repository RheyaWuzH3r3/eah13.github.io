Lyft is now my ride of choice (when I don't have a Relayride, of course).  It's consistently cheaper than Uber, especially if you use their Lyft Line ridesharing option.  It also doesn't have questionable practices or crazy 3x surge pricing.

When I'm in a car-unfriendly city like New York to pitch investors, I stay in a super cheap Airbnb, bunkbed or couch if I have to, and Lyft to the meetings.  There's nothing like knowing you'll be early to a meeting and not having to worry about finding the right building, etc.

Once the meeting's over I schlep it home on foot or by bus like the poor startup founder I am :)

Use the link below to sign up and we'll both get a $10 credit.  Schweet!
