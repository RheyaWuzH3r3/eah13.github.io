**Edit: Nitrous rolled out a major upgrade that is too slow and unreliable for serious use. I now recommend Cloud9 over Nitrous.**  

Nitrous is an online coding environment and IDE that works in any browser.  I use in in my chromebook to make this site and used it to teach my Python course at UNC Chapel Hill.  You'll dig it.
