**Edit: the Verison Jetpack is still going strong but I decided to use my phone's inferior hotspot ability once my travel 
schedule cooled down a little.  I'll very likely add it back if I start traveling massively again.  So, I still recommended
it (or whatever Jetpack is not current and has long battery life) but I no longer use it**

Verizon's MHS291L Jetpack has 15 hours of battery life and gives you broadband speeds from almost anywhere.  If you're travelling regularly like most CEOs do, you need it.  If you're a developer who likes to work outdoors this puppy will set you free.
