Google Apps for Work is amazing.  You want your entire company in Google from the beginning, with everyone using Gmail and Drive.

Gmail

* Learn the Gmail keyboard shortcuts and use them. 
* Archive your email fanatically.  This keeps it searchable but gets it out of your hair.
* Make lots of emails show up in your inbox at once.  You need information density.

Drive

* Set your default setting so everyone can find and edit all docs

Plus

* Google Plus sucks.  Turn it off at the Apps level
