This site is a collection of cool tools, articles, and links I've found.  It's for my own reference and convenience and I hope it helps you too!  If this site ever seems a little out of date, well, check me on <a href="http://unc.academia.edu/elliott">Academia</a>, <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/elliotthauser">Linkedin</a>, or <a  href="http://github.com/eah13">GitHub</a> because I'm probably up to something fun.  And, as of 2012 I've been using <a href="http://plus.google.com/101710108233003380197">my G+ page</a> as a blog of sorts.

In general, the topmost categories below are most current.

You'll find my <a href="http://elliott.web.unc.edu/professional-resume/">Resume</a> &amp; <a href="http://elliott.web.unc.edu/academic-cv/">CV</a> under the Pages to the left.
