What Wordpress giveth, Jekyll taketh away.

I'm migrating my blog/site from Wordpress to Jekyll.  Very. Slowly.  It'll probably be in a state of flux for a while but there may be some generalizable code that comes out of this that might be useful to others.

Roadmap
* [ Done ] Import posts
* [ Done ] Emulate `visibility` and `hidden` behavior of current wordpress theme and general style/look/feel
* [ Working on ] Fix styling bugs
* [ Not Started ] Frankenstein surgery (i.e. clean up my hacks)
* [ Not Started ] Implement some new ideas
* [ Not Started ] Deploy
