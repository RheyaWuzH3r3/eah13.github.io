=================



I'm "done" (so to speak) migrating [my blog/site](http://elliotthauser.com) from Wordpress to Jekyll.  Don't look at the code it's mostly gross.  This took oh a year or two, during which I had a wide range of ability and/or bandwith to throw at it.  It was slow and largely unplanned.  

Now this is the source for the github pages hosted version.  It looks decent from the outside.  Yay.

### Contributing

Pull requests welcome, especially from those new to open source!  Also happy to help anyone who wants a little help forking and making it their own.
