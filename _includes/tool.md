This is a list of tools I've found helpful as a founder of [Trinket](http://trinket.io).  I'm endorsing them here along with why I've found them useful in the hopes that you'll find them useful as you start your own company.  A few of these are affiliate links - if you decide to buy using these links I'll make a tiny amount of money which I will spend trying out new stuff and writing it up here.

It's never the stuff that makes you great.  But great stuff can make the journey easier.

Thanks again and as always feel free to [email me](elliott+reveiws@trinket.io) if you have suggestions of how I could make this section better.
