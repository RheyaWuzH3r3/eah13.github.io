I'm building the easiest way to teach using open materials at [trinket.io](http://trinket.io).  I've studied Art History at Duke, Information Science at UNC, and have taught introduction to programming at UNC.  I like philosophy, photography, and live in Durham, NC.

Tweeting at me is the best way to get in touch if we haven't met.  I look forward to hearing from you!
